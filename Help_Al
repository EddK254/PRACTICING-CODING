alias: alias
       It will define/display the aliases.

    `alias' has no arguments, and it prints a list of aliases in reusable
    form `alias NAME=VALUE'. This is on standard output.

    An alias is herein defined for each NAME, and VALUE given.
    In VALUE, there is trailing whitespace which ensures next word is checked for
    alias substitution when alias is expanded.

    Options:
	NONE
    Exit Status:
    alias returns true unless NAME is supplied for which no alias is
    defined.
